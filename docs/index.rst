pyprop8
=======

``pyprop8`` is a lightweight Python package to calculate the seismic response of a
1-D layered half-space. It implements an algorithm described in `O'Toole &
Woodhouse (2011) <https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/187/3/1516/616302>`_. It
also enables computation of the gradient of the seismic response with respect
to source parameters, as described in `O'Toole et al. (2012)
<https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/191/1/257/586793>`_.

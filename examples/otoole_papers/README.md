This directory contains scripts that aim to reproduce the figures and examples from [O'Toole & Woodhouse (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2011.05210.x) and [O'Toole et al. (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2012.05608.x). In addition to `pyprop8`, these scripts require `matplotlib` to be installed.

Some minor differences can be seen between some of the output here, and the figures within the papers. These are likely due to differences in the way the source time functions are implemented and applied; unfortunately, the papers do not fully describe this step.
